# SHAFAZ WEB to Android

SHAFAZ WebView is an Android project that allows you to wrap your website in a super simple Android app. It is ideal for single page web app with on-screen/no navigation. For example, a game, interactive page, web-based slideshow, etc. If you are a web developer who wants to release an Android app, this should help you cut some corners when it comes to learning Java. There is just one config file to set up everything, simply edit the included config file.
